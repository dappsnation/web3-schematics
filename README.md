# Web3 Schematics

This repository is an example of an Angular application using the `@dnation/web3`.

To add `web3` to your Angular project run : 

```bash
ng add @dnation/web3
```

## Important
To use custom configuration with `webpack` we need to change the builders from `angular.json`.
If you're using `@angular/material` please add it before adding `@dnation/web3` or it would not work.
